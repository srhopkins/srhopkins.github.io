The more I version control the more organized my life feels; that may be too metaphysical but it seems true. The more I version control the more I run into "complicated" versioning scenerios where I need more Git foo. Here I will document the fundamentals I know and share my findings and research on the more "advanced" techniques. I welcome any suggestions for improving Git effeciency

I'll loop back to <a href="http://hub.github.com/">Hub</a>, a great Git helper for GitHub, but begin with what I believe to be the fundamentals.
