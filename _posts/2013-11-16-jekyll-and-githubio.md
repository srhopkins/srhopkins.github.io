I'm a Python guy, but after several bouts of blog trying to find my dreamy blogging application I settled on jekyll. I didn't want to learn all the details (albeit few they really are) needed to get a functional jekyll blog off the ground. I settled on jekyll-bootstrap. Which pretty much had it all; even with their easy detailed instructions I still ran into a few hiccups... what better way to start blogging than by documenting the results.

My other criteria was to utilize one of the many free hosting services available. For this I turned to <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>. This is a fairly straight forward process too but a few minor nuances needed to be massaged out.

Adapted from <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/usage/jekyll-quick-start.html">Jekyll-Bootstrap QuickStart</a>.

    git clone https://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap.git username.github.io
    cd username.github.io
