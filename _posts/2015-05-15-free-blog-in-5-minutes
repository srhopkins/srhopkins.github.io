There are several good blogs on getting started with blogging on GitHub Pages. I am hoping to get your blog operational in 5 minutes, minus searching for your theme.

 - Find a good jekyll theme, I suggest <a href="https://github.com/poole/poole">poole</a>. Another good place to start your search is <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/">here</a>.
 - If your theme is on github just fork it and rename it to yourusername.github.io `Settings >> Repository name >> Rename`.
 - If you have a custom domain add the github <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/tips-for-configuring-an-a-record-with-your-dns-provider/">IP</a> to your DNS provider record <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-cname-file-to-your-repository/">CNAME</a> file in root of repository.
